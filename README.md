# Computer alarm

A script to set off an alarm when someone presses a key on the keyboard.

Use when you need to go to the bathroom at school and don't trust the guy sitting next to you.

How to use: I reccomend to turn on the script then minimize VS code or any other editor you are
using to run the script. Unless the person who set it off knows there is an editor open and
turns it off they will most likely get embarressed and shut the laptop.
